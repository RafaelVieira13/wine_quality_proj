# Wine Quality Calssification Model

## Overview
The aim of this project is to develop a classification predictive model for wine quality using its physiochemical properties. Wine quality is influenced by various factors, such as alcohol content, pH levels, acidity, residual sugar, and more. However, alcohol content is known to have the highest correlation with wine quality.

To achieve the project goal, a random forest model was built using a dataset of wine samples with their respective physiochemical properties and quality ratings. The model achieved an accuracy of 94.21%, indicating that it can predict wine quality with high accuracy.

This model can have practical applications in the wine industry, where winemakers can use it to predict the quality of their wines based on their physiochemical properties. Additionally, it can also help consumers to make informed decisions when purchasing wines based on their quality predictions. However, it is important to note that the model's performance should be validated on new, unseen data to ensure its generalizability.
